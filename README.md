The data used in this model can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/kazanova/sentiment140

Prepared the data by removing common stopwords and punctuation from the text then applied stemming and lemmatization. Model was created using LSTM(Long Short Term Memory) to help predict the next word using the previous one. Incorperated dropout layers aswell. The model predicts weather a tweet has a positive meaning(1) or a negative meaning(0).
